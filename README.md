# Epidemic Simulation (Extended)

This project is a **refactored and extended version** of [Prajwal Souza’s Epidemic Simulation](https://github.com/prajwalsouza/Epidemic-Simulation), originally inspired by 3Blue1Brown's video [*Simulating an Epidemic*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxAaO2rsdIs).

## What I Added / Changed

- 🧼 **Code Refactor**: Reorganized and cleaned up core logic, styles, and layout for better maintainability.
- 📈 **SIRD Model Integration**: Extended the simulation to support the SIRD (Susceptible–Infected–Recovered–Deceased) model.
- 🖥️ **Interface Enhancements**: Updated UI for better usability and parameter control.
- 🚀 **Performance Improvements** *(if applicable)*: Optimized simulation loop and animation rendering.
